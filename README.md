Notes: HW1, HW3 and HW4 are self-explanatory. All of them have been completed 100%. Every question in the problem statement has a corresponding file for submission, either provinding the required function in haskell or oz, or giving a required proof as per the question. HW2 however, is a bit complex with respect to understandability and certain assumptions. Hence, the HW2 folder is provided with a separate README.
